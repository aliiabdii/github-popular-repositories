## GitHub Popular Repositories

This is a GitHub Repository search service developed with Java 17 and [Micronaut Framework](https://guides.micronaut.io/index.html).
It provides an API to search among the GitHub repositories (using the [GitHub public search API](https://api.github.com))
and fetch the most popular ones.

To run the code, simply execute `.\gradlew run` in the root of the project. Once the project is running, 
you can test the API directly, or though the swagger page at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui
